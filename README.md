# **Rainfall Prediction Project** 🌧️


🗂️ **Project Structure:**

The project includes the following components:

1️⃣ **`RainPrediction.ipynb`:**
This Jupyter Notebook is the heart of our project. It contains the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and rainfall prediction using machine learning algorithms. We utilize the weather dataset (`weatherAUS.csv`) to build our predictive models.

📊 **Dataset:**
The `weatherAUS.csv` file is included in the project structure. It is a comprehensive weather dataset that provides historical weather information, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. We utilize this dataset to train our models and predict rainfall.

#
**🚀 Getting Started:**
To run the code and explore the project:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook in the provided Google Colab link.
- Make sure you have access to the `weatherAUS.csv` file and upload it to the notebook's environment.
- Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and predict rainfall based on the provided features.
- Feel free to experiment, modify the code, and tweak the models to improve the accuracy of rainfall prediction.

 #

🌧️ **Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict rainfall based on historical weather data. By leveraging various algorithms and the provided dataset, we aim to enhance our understanding of rainfall patterns and improve prediction capabilities.
